# Swift Bootcamp Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for the Swift Bootcamp assignments.  
Each task focuses on a different concept in Swift, gradually increasing in difficulty.

## Assignments

Tap a task to see its title, description, and SF Symbol. The app features dynamic background colors on view load and allows swipe-to-delete for tasks.
